## Consent preferences

Entities in the consent preferences are defined by the following UML diagram
```mermaid
classDiagram
  class Data {
    id: string/uri
    authorizationLevel: string
    conditions: Condition[]
  }
  class Service {
    id: string/uri
    authorizationLevel: string
    conditions: Condition[]
  }
  class Participant {
    id: string/uri
    asDataProvider: Data
    asServiceProvider: Service
  }
  class Condition {
    time: TimeCondition
    location: LocationCondition
  }
  class TimeCondition {
    dayOfWeek: string[]
    startTime: string
    endTime: string
  }
  class LocationCondition {
    countryCode: string
  }

## Contract Profiles

For organizations within the dataspace, they are subject to negotiate and contractualise for the usage of their data or services under a certain set of ODRL policies. The contract profile and agent would enable a streamlined experience in setting up ODRL policies and their values when negotiating with new organisations if similar data or services has been configured within the contract profile.

```mermaid
classDiagram
  class ContractProfile {
    id: string/uri
    dataCategories: DataCategory[]
    services: Service[]
  }
  class Data {
    id: string/uri
    policy: ODRLPolicy
  }
  class Service {
    id: string/uri
    policy: ODRLPolicy
  }
  class ODRLPolicy {
    id: string/uri
    value: string
  }

  ContractProfile -- Data
  ContractProfile -- Service
  Data -- ODRLPolicy
  Service -- ODRLPolicy
```

Organizations can create a contract profile where they define various data categories and services they offer or utilize. For each data category and service, organizations specify the corresponding ODRL policies, including permissions, prohibitions, obligations, and constraints. When negotiating with new organizations or entities, the contract negotiating agent leverages these pre-configured contract profiles. It identifies similarities between the data categories and services involved, utilizing existing policies and values whenever possible to expedite the negotiation process. This approach not only accelerates negotiation but also ensures consistency and compliance across contractual agreements within the dataspace ecosystem.

## Matching

### Consent Matching
The consent negotiating agent interacts with the catalog to identify similar types of data and services based on individuals' consent preferences. By analyzing consent profiles, the agent discerns the authorization levels, conditions, and preferences set by individuals regarding data usage.

Leveraging this information, it proposes potential data exchanges to individuals, recommending suitable data sources or services that align with their consent preferences. This process ensures that individuals have access to relevant and permissible data within the dataspace.

### Contract Matching
The contract negotiating agent utilizes the catalog to identify comparable data categories and services based on organizations' contract profiles. By examining the ODRL policies and values specified in the contract profiles, the agent identifies relevant organizations and datasets that align with the contractual agreements and obligations defined by the organizations.

It then proposes potential partners or datasets to organizations, facilitating streamlined negotiations and partnerships within the dataspace.

This approach enables organizations to efficiently discover and engage with compatible partners and datasets, optimizing data sharing and utilization while ensuring adherence to contractual agreements and regulatory requirements.

## Architecture

1. **Negotiating Agents**: The core components responsible for managing consent and contract negotiations. These agents communicate with individuals, organizations, and the catalog to gather and analyze consent preferences and contract profiles.
2. **Catalog Integration**: Integration with the catalog system to access metadata about available data sources, services, and organizations within the dataspace. This integration enables the negotiating agents to identify relevant data and services based on consent preferences and contract profiles.
3. **Consent Management Module**: A module responsible for managing consent preferences of individuals. It allows individuals to set and update their consent preferences, including authorization levels and conditions for data uage.
4. **Contract Management Module**: A module dedicated to managing contract profiles of organizations. It enables organizations to define ODRL policies and values for data categories and services, facilitating streamlined negotiations with potential partners.
5. **Communication Interface**: An interface for communication between the negotiating agents, individuals, organizations and the catalog. This interface ensures seamless exchange of consent preferences, contract profiles, and negotiation proposals.
6. **Data Exchange Proposals**: Components responsible for generating data exchange proposals for individuals based on their consent preferences and for proposing relevant organizations or datasets to organizations based on their contract profiles.
7. **Authorization Level Evaluation**: Components for evaluating authorization levels and conditions specified in consent preferences and contract profiles. These components determine the permissibility of data exchanges and partnerships.
8. **Logging**: Mechanisms for logging operations and monitoring the performance of the agents and related components.
9. **Error Handling & Recovery**: Strategies and mechanisms for handling errors and recovering from failures gracefully.
